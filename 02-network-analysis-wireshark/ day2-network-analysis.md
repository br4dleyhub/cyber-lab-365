# DAY 2 - NETWORK ANALYSIS WIRESHARK



#### **OBJECTIVE**



Capture and analyze network traffic generated by:

* ping
* traceroute
* curl



*Using Wireshark on Kali Linux.*



#### This helps understand:



* ICMP packet structure
* DNS resolution
* TCP handshake
* HTTP GET / 200 OK
* Traffic flow inside a virtual lab





#### **ENVIRONMENT**



Kali Linux (Attacker): 192.168.187.50

Windows 11 (Victim #1): 192.168.187.60

Ubuntu Server (Victim #2): 192.168.187.70

Network Mode: NAT

Wireshark Interface: eth0







#### PART 1 — ICMP ANALYSIS (PING)



1. Start Wireshark

&nbsp;	Apply filter: icmp



On **Kali**, run:

* ping 192.168.187.60



#### You should capture:



* *ICMP Echo Request*
* *ICMP Echo Reply*
* *TTL values*
* *Round trip times*

#### PART 2 — DNS + ROUTING ANALYSIS (TRACEROUTE)



Wireshark filter: dns || icmp



On Kali, run: traceroute google.com



###### Expected capture:



* *DNS request for google.com*
* *DNS response with IP*
* *ICMP "Time Exceeded" packets (multiple hops)*

#### PART 3 — HTTP TRAFFIC ANALYSIS (CURL)

#### 

Wireshark filter: http



On Kali, run:  curl http://testphp.vulnweb.com



###### Expected capture:



* *TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK)*
* *HTTP GET request*
* *HTTP/1.1 200 OK response*
* *HTML content*
* *Server headers (Apache, PHP version)*

#### KEY FINDINGS



1. ICMP
2. Ping shows hosts are reachable.
3. You can see Echo Request and Reply packets clearly.
4. DNS
5. DNS request and response flow is visible in Wireshark.
6. Confirms DNS resolution inside the network.
7. HTTP
8. Full GET request and server response captured.
9. Able to observe HTML content transferred.
10. TCP
11. 3-way handshake successfully captured.
12. Connection termination packets (FIN/ACK) visible.





#### WHAT I LEARNED



* How to capture and analyze real network traffic



* How ICMP, DNS, TCP, and HTTP work in practice



* How to interpret packet flows inside a virtual lab



* How network requests look at a packet level



* How to use Wireshark for protocol-level analysis
